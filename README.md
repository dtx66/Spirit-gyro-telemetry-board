# Spirit-gyro-telemetry-board

First, Thanks my Friend Jonathan NI, for the drawing.

This is a PCB print file for Spirit gyro telemetry board. Only for CC & HW ESC.

For CC, need a 10Kohm resistor between "signal" & "+", and short circuit the middle pad

For HW, do not need anything to soldering. You must know the cable connection direction both side

The marked "S" and "+" is wrong, NEED for reversed when your soldering !
