# Spirit-gyro-telemetry-board



This is a PCB print file for Spirit gyro telemetry board. Only for CC ESC & HW ESC.

For CC ESC, need a 10Kohm resistor between "signal" & "+", and short circuit the middle pad

For HW ESC, do not need anything to soldering. You must know the order of wiring on both sides

The marked "S" and "+" is wrong, NEED for reversed when your soldering !
